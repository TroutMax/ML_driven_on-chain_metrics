Phase 1: Planning & Data Collection
Define key objectives, target coins, and success metrics (e.g., identifying coins surviving pump-and-dumps).

Identify and connect to data sources:
On-chain analytics (Dune Analytics, Glassnode)
Price data (CoinGecko, CryptoDataDownload)
Social sentiment scraping/APIs (X/Twitter, Reddit)
Bot trading volume or exchange volume spikes
Build initial data ingestion scripts and store raw data locally or in a database.

Phase 2: Feature Engineering & Labeling
Preprocess and clean raw data, handle missing values.
Develop and compute composite on-chain, price, and sentiment features with appropriate time windows and aggregations.
Create labels for supervised learning (e.g., pump-and-dump survival, price movement classification).
Explore data visualization for feature understanding and correlation.

Phase 3: Model Development & Validation
Train baseline models (logistic regression, random forest) with cross-validation respecting temporal order.

Analyse feature importances and refine feature set.
Experiment with advanced models (gradient boosting, LSTM) for sequential pattern recognition.
Validate with backtesting on holdout periods, focusing on real-world profitability and false positive rates.

Phase 4: Deployment & Automation
Build pipeline to retrain models regularly and update features.
Develop alert/dashboard system highlighting buy signals and warnings from model predictions.
Automate data collection, prediction generation, and notifications (e.g., email, message).
Monitor model performance and drift, set up logging and error handling
